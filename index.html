    <h1>Beginning HTML and CSS</h1>

    <p>This is a simple template repo that includes an HTML document and a corresponding stylesheet (CSS). 
        Use these files to complete the following tasks for this assignment:</p>

    <h2>Clone the Repo. <br> <br> <br>Or don't. Your call.</h2>

    <aside>Look over here! Hello!<br><br>How are you?<br><br>Oh, me? I'm alright.</aside>

    <p>Clone this repo to your local machine using Visual Studio Code.</p>

    <h2>Make Changes &#128512</h2>

    <p>Click the "Go Live" button &#128308 in VS Code so you can see the effects of your changes as you make them.</p>

    <p>Make some changes to this HTML page. Try to include some tags that we didn't go over in class.
    You can find out more about HTML on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3schools HTML tutorial</a>.
    Maybe try to imagine something you'd like to add to the document and find the tags needed to do it.
    (For example: a table, a button, an emoji, etc.)
